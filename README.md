Ardulight
=========

Tools and Arduino sketch for boblight

One basic arduino can output 12 PWM channels using software PWM.
The sketch located in arduino/ allows to use boblight with and arduino and have 12 outputs.
To achieve such functionnality, it uses the SoftPWM library from Palatis (
)
boblight-cycle is a boblight client which cycle through visible colors to achieve a fading effect.
Finally, the boblight.conf file allows to use the provided sketch and use the 12 outputs.
